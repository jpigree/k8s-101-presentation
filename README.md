# k8s-presentation
The repo containing files used for my k8s presentation

- the slides are available as a pdf file in the root directory.
- each demo in the slides has a corresponding directory in "demos" with a "cmds" file which indicate the various commands of the demo
- "helloworld" contains the source files for the mini application we deploy
- "ops" contains the scripts with which I create and delete the GKE cluster.
